## Usage

Users can visit the site and log their workouts through a modal revealed through the '+New Workout' button. Within the modal, users may choose which week they are logging, type of muscle group exercised, and weight in pounds lifted. 

Muscle groups include: chest, arms, shoulders, back, legs, abs

User input is then recorded in local storage and displayed graphically on the landing page tracking weights/week.

Users can also utilise the nutrition information feature to enter different types of food in the search bar which returns nutrition information including calories, protein, carbs, and fat.

To further enhance the user experience, a random motivational quote is displayed upon clicking the "Let's Get Motivated" button.


## API Usage

Several APIs were utilized in the creation of this application, including [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/) for nutrition analysis, [type.fit](https://type.fit/api/quotes) for random motivational quotes, and [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) for rendering chart graphics.

## Roadmap

Should development continue in the future, we intend to allow for more dynamic data based on dates rather than week numbers, as well as to include a graph that shows the user their total progress over time.
